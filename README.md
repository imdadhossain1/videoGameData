Description: 
The motivation for my project is to help gamers find a video game that they can truly enjoy by filtering through categories with a simple API request.

Tecnologies Used:
React.js, Node.js

Getting Started:
Filter games by company, platform, etc. and view whatever information you want on the game from character models, to age ratings to artwork



User Stories: 

As a gamer, I want to be able to search for a game to play through different categories, so I can sift through all the games out there.
